## Application Overview

**Reelit** is an interactive fishing platform that lets users:

- **Explore** a map of lakes, rivers, and other bodies of water.
- **Search** for a specific fish or the types of fish found in a specific area
- **Log and share** their catches by uploading photos, notes, and tips to the community. 
- **Discover** popular fishing spots and community-posted tips.
- **Manage** personal profiles, track catch history, and follow friends.

Built as a full-stack MERN app (with a React web client and a Flutter Android app),
Reelit provides both browser and mobile experiences for fishing enthusiasts and beginners alike.

This repository contains a MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) application with both web and
mobile front-ends. Below is an overview of the setup, current progress, and instructions for
getting started.
